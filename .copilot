# GitHub Copilot Project Configuration

# Project: PrimeCodex - EMOTA Unity Framework
# This file provides context for GitHub Copilot and AI assistants

# Key project characteristics:
# - Experimental research codebase focused on emotional-motivational AI
# - Python 3.10+ with OpenAI API integration
# - Strong security practices for API key management
# - Modular architecture with clear subsystem boundaries

# Important patterns to follow:
# - Always mock network calls in tests
# - Never commit secrets or API keys
# - Use clear, descriptive naming for experimental concepts
# - Maintain backward compatibility in configuration
# - Follow the development checklist in README.md

# Preferred coding style:
# - Use type hints where helpful
# - Clear docstrings for complex logic
# - Modular, testable functions
# - Consistent error handling patterns

# Security requirements:
# - API keys via environment variables only
# - Use .env files (gitignored) for local development
# - Pre-commit hooks for secret scanning
# - Immediate rotation if secrets are accidentally committed
